# Engineering Books
Softcopy of Engineering (Electrical) and Computer Science Books.
If you want a book(s) to be taken down, please contact me.
I do not own any of the books. Just doing my part sharing books to fellow engineering students. Taken from different sources.

I will keep updating the books based on recommendations and requests from my colleagues or anyone else. If you want to give a recommendation, DM @gigahidjrikaaa via Instagram.

Take note that this repo can disappear at ANY time due to copyright reasons.

# Personal Recommendations
This is the list of books that I personally recommend. These books are the ones that I use in my studies. Take note that I study Information Engineering at Universitas Gadjah Mada, where the 2021 curriculum is based on MIT curriculum (at least for the first 2 semesters).  
This list is not sorted in any way. You can click on the name of the book to download it.
